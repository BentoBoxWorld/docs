Placeholders allow you to display data from any BentoBox's addons or gamemodes in other plugins. And the opposite is true as well!

## How to use placeholders?

### Download the placeholder API you need.

BentoBox uses [**PlaceholderAPI**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) for placeholders.

### Launch the server and you're ready to go!

Regardless of the placeholder API you're using, just start the server. There are **no expansions to download**: BentoBox handles everything!

## How to display a placeholder in the chat?

If you're using **EssentialsChat** and **PlaceholderAPI**, you **must** install [**ChatInjector**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatinjector.38327/) in order for the placeholders to show up in the chat. However, please note it has been reported that ChatInjector might cause issues.

We recommend you to use an alternative chat plugin which supports PlaceholderAPI, such as [**ChatControl**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrol%E2%84%A2-the-ultimate-chat-plugin-500-000-downloads-1-2-5-1-14-4.271/).

## How to suggest a new placeholder?

If you think a placeholder for BentoBox or another default placeholder for gamemodes should be added, then please submit a [placeholder request](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BentoBox/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Status%3A+Pending%2C+Type%3A+Enhancement&template=placeholder_request.md&title=Placeholder%3A+).

## Default placeholders for gamemode addons

All gamemode addons get some default placeholders automatically registered to them.
