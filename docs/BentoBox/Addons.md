# Install Addons

Firstly, you need to download the Addons you want to add to your server. Official ones can be found on [BentoBoxWorld's repositories list](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld) (links provided above) and can be downloaded from their `Releases` tab (or from [Jenkins](https://ci.codemc.org/job/BentoBoxWorld/) for **untested** development builds).

Once you have downloaded everything you need, you just have to put them all in the `plugins\BentoBox\addons` folder, boot up your server so that config files and folders get created, and finally turn it off again in order to be able to edit everything without causing any harm to your server.

Please note that Addons may sometimes be incompatible with the version of BentoBox you're using. Official Addons will **always** be provided with a clear statement of which version they support. However, note that they often support newer versions without needing to be updated.
