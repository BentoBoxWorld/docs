# Concurrent Islands

Bentobox 2.0.0 and later enable admins to allow players to have more than one island per world. This page explains about how it works and some of the implications of allowing it.

## How to enable

By default, players have one island. The number can be increased globally via the BentoBox `config.yml` under the `island.concurrent-islands` setting. This value may be overridden by individual game mode config settings if they offer this setting too.

## How to use

### Creation

If players are allowed to make more than one island, then they can do so by using the `create` command, for example:

`/island create`

This operates the same as any other island creation and the player will usually be teleported to the island after it is created.

### Going to islands

Once players have more than one island, they can teleport between them by using the `go` command, for example:

`/island go`

This command will show any named homes that they player has set along with the names of any islands the player has. If the player has named their island using the `setname` command, then it will be in the list, but if they have not, then the island will be listed by the default island name followed by a number, for example "tastybento's island 2". The number of the island may change when the server is restarted, so players should be encouraged to name their islands.

### Setting homes

Players can set the default location of their island by running the `sethome` command. If players have the ability to set multiple homes, then they can set them using the `sethome [home name]` command. The maximum number of homes allowed in the config for the game world is shared across all the islands tat the player owns.

### Island transfer

Island ownership can be transfered to other players on the team using the `setowner` command. Ownership cannot be transfered if the owner already has the maximum number of concurrent islands allowed.

*NEW:* When a player transfers ownership then now automatically leave the team.

### Teams

- Teams are island-based and teams do not span islands.
- As of BentoBox 2.3.0, there is a setting in to allow team members to have their own islands, in which case players can be members of multiple teams on different islands.

## Game Mode Support

All game modes should support concurrent islands.
