# PlaceHolders

**AcidIsland** does not have any placeholders of its own but it integrates with other BentoBox addons, like Level and Likes. 

To use these placeholders, you just need to replace `[gamemode]` with `acidisland` and the placeholder will work.

For example: `%acidisland_world_friendly_name%`

You can find a list of available placeholders here: [Placeholders](/BentoBox/Placeholders).
