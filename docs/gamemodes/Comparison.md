# Choosing a Game Mode

Not sure which game mode to run on your server? This page compares all the official BentoBox game modes to help you decide.

You can also run **more than one** at the same time — many servers offer two or three game modes so players can choose their preferred experience.

## Quick Comparison

| Game Mode | Setting | Difficulty | Main Challenge | Multiplayer Focus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **BSkyBlock** | Sky (floating islands) | Medium | Expand from a tiny island in the void | Medium |
| **AOneBlock** | Sky (void) | Medium | Mine a single magical block that never runs out | Low–Medium |
| **AcidIsland** | Sea (acid ocean) | Medium–Hard | Skyblock with dangerous acid water | Medium |
| **CaveBlock** | Underground | Medium | Carve out space in a solid stone world | Medium |
| **SkyGrid** | Sky (scattered blocks) | Hard | Collect resources from a grid of single blocks | Low |
| **Boxed** | Normal world | Easy–Medium | Complete advancements to grow your confined space | Medium |
| **Poseidon** | Ocean | Medium | Survive entirely underwater | Medium |
| **StrangerRealms** | Overworld + Upside Down | Medium–Hard | Claim land while managing a dangerous mirror dimension | Medium–High |

## Which Should I Choose?

### I want the most popular, well-known experience
**BSkyBlock** — Classic Skyblock is what most players already know. It has the largest community, the most resources, and is a safe choice for any server.

### I want something fresh but still approachable
**AOneBlock** — The concept (one magical block) is easy to explain and immediately engaging. The built-in phase progression keeps players motivated for a long time.

### I want Skyblock but harder
**AcidIsland** — Same feel as BSkyBlock but falling in the ocean is genuinely dangerous. Good for players who found regular Skyblock too easy.

### I want an underground / mining theme
**CaveBlock** — Instead of building up in the sky, players dig out from solid ground. The experience feels very different despite sharing most of BentoBox's mechanics.

### I want to cater to advanced / hardcore players
**SkyGrid** — The scattered block world is unforgiving. Resources are spread out, movement is dangerous, and survival requires real skill. Not recommended as the only option on a server with new players.

### I want something tied to vanilla progression
**Boxed** — The advancement-driven expansion mechanic connects the game directly to vanilla Minecraft goals. Good for players who enjoy structured progression.

### I want a unique visual theme
**Poseidon** — An entirely aquatic world looks stunning and plays very differently. Great as a secondary option for players who want something visually distinct.

### I want a story-inspired experience with complex mechanics
**StrangerRealms** — The Upside Down mirror dimension adds a layer of strategy. Better suited to players who are comfortable with Minecraft and ready for something more involved.

## Feature Support by Game Mode

Most BentoBox addons work with all game modes. A few have specific compatibility requirements.

\* StrangerRealms has its own built-in border system — do not use the Border addon with it.

\*\* StrangerRealms replaces the Nether with the Upside Down dimension.

## Running Multiple Game Modes

Each game mode runs completely independently — separate worlds, separate island databases, separate configs. Players can have an island in each game mode at the same time.

If you run multiple game modes, strongly consider installing the **InvSwitcher** addon. Without it, players share the same inventory, experience, and health across all game mode worlds, which can cause confusion and exploits.
