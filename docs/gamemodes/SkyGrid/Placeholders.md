# SkyGrid PlaceHolders

**SkyGrid** does not have specific placeholders but uses BentoBox addons that implements placeholders, like Likes.

To use these placeholders, you just need to replace `[gamemode]` with `skygrid` and placeholder will work.

For example: `%skygrid_world_friendly_name%`

You can find a list of available placeholders here: [BentoBox Placeholders](../../BentoBox/Placeholders/#default-placeholders-for-gamemode-addons).
