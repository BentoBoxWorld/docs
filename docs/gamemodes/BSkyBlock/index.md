## History
**BSkyBlock** is the evolution of **ASkyBlock** for newer Minecraft server versions.

## Installation

0. Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders.
1. Place this jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin.
2. Restart the server.
3. The addon will create worlds and a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml.
4. Stop the server .
5. Edit the config.yml how you want.
6. Delete any worlds that were created by default if you made changes that would affect them.
7. Restart the server.

## Config.yml

The config.yml is similar to ASkyBlock but *not the same*. Note that distance between islands and protection range are **radius values** so the island size will be twice these values in blocks! Also, the distance between islands will be set automatically to a chunk boundary (a multiple of 16 blocks).
